    "#### Syntax error refers to an error in the syntax or structure of the code, meaning that the code is not written according to the rules of the programming language. These errors are usually caught by the compiler or interpreter before the code is executed, and they prevent the code from being compiled or run. For example, a missing semicolon at the end of a statement in JavaScript or a missing parenthesis in a function call in Python would result in a syntax error.  On the other hand, an exception refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program. These errors are not caught by the compiler or interpreter and can cause the program to terminate or behave unexpectedly. Exceptions can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as division by zero, trying to access an array element that does not exist, or attempting to open a file that does not exist.\n"

Instead of raising a generic exception, you can raise a custom exception that describes exactly what went wrong.
